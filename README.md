# User Management

This is a user management application built with Vue.js, Pinia, and Vue I18n. It supports dark mode and multiple languages.

## Features

- Display a list of users with filtering, searching, and sorting.
- View and edit user details.
- Dark mode support.
- Multiple language support.
- Accessible and compliant with WCAG AA standards.
- Unit tests with Vitest.
- E2E tests with Cypress.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohamed2678/user-management.git

## API Optimization Strategies
- **Debouncing API Requests:** Reduce unnecessary API calls in search filters.
- **Pagination & Lazy Loading:** Implement infinite scrolling or lazy loading where needed.
- **Client-Side Caching:** Use Pinia or Vue Query to cache user data with expiration.
- **Batch API Requests:** Group multiple API calls instead of making separate requests.
- **Background Syncing:** Fetch updates in the background at regular intervals.

## Shared Logic Handling
- **Composable Functions:** Extract reusable logic into Vue 3 composables (`useUsers.ts`, `usePagination.ts`).
- **Pinia Stores:** Manage centralized state for users, filters, and permissions.
- **Mixins (if needed):** For deeply shared computed properties.
- **Event Bus (Minimal Use):** Lightweight communication between sibling components.

## Client-Side Data Caching
- **Pinia Store with TTL:** Cache API responses and refresh only when necessary.
- **IndexedDB:** Store large data sets using `idb` library.
- **Vue Query:** Automatically cache API responses with background re-fetching.
- **Local Storage:** Store persistent UI preferences (filters, last visited page).
- **Stale-While-Revalidate:** Serve cached data first, then fetch fresh data in the background.

## Scaling User Permissions
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** `{ role: "Admin", permissions: ["read", "write", "delete"] }`
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Dynamic rules based on user attributes.
- **Server-Managed Permissions:** Retrieve permission sets dynamically from `/api/permissions`.
- **Tree Structure for Permissions:** Organize permissions hierarchically.
- **Caching & Memoization:** Cache permissions client-side to reduce re-fetching.

## Testing Strategy
### Unit Tests (Jest + Vue Test Utils)
- Test Pinia store actions (`fetchUsers`, `updateUser`).
- Ensure composables (`useUsers.ts`) return expected results.
- Test individual Vue components (`UserForm.vue`).

### Integration Tests (Vue Test Utils + Mock API)
- Mock API calls and test component interactions (`UserDashboard.vue`).
- Validate form submission and handling (`UserEditForm.vue`).

### End-to-End Tests (Cypress or Playwright)
- Simulate user interactions (login, edit user, change roles).
- Validate navigation and routing.

### What NOT to Test
- Third-party libraries (e.g., Vue Toastification).
- Simple template rendering unless it contains dynamic logic.

## Offline Capabilities
- **Service Workers:** Use Workbox for caching API responses.
- **IndexedDB + Background Sync:** Store data locally and sync when back online.
- **Local Storage for UI State:** Keep UI settings persistent.
- **Graceful UI Handling:** Display an "Offline Mode" banner with retry options.
- **Optimistic UI Updates:** Apply user actions instantly and sync them when online.
